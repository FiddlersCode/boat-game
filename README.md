# Boat Game

### About
This was a simple command-line game I created with my 8-year-old nephew to teach him some basic Ruby and coding principles.  

It would make a good template for anyone who wants to fork and make another TDD'd children's game.  The storyline can obviously be adapted to whatever your child (or you!) fancies.

## To Run
1. Clone file
2. Run `bundle`
3. Run `script.rb` to launch the game in the command line.  Follow the user prompts.

## Run the tests
`rspec`
